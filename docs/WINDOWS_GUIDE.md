## Visual C++ Redistributable

### Why It's Needed

The Route Planner Windows executable requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable due to dependencies on native extensions that are compiled with Microsoft Visual C++.

### Potential Issues

Without the Visual C++ Redistributable, you may encounter an error like:
```
Unhandled exception: unimplemented function ucrtbase.dll.crealf called in 64-bit code
```

### Solutions

1. **Use the Bundled Package (Recommended)**: Includes VCRedist and automatic setup
2. **Use the Installer**: Automatically handles VCRedist installation
3. **Manual Installation**: Download from Microsoft: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
