# Scripts Directory

This directory contains essential utility scripts for building, installing, and running the Route Planner application.

## Entry Point Clarification

The Route Planner has multiple entry points for different use cases:

- **`route-planner`** (installed command) - **Recommended for end users**
- **`../main.py`** - Development and direct execution
- **`../route_planner.py`** - Cross-platform launcher with path detection
- **`run_route_planner.sh/bat`** - Platform-specific with environment setup

## Overview

These scripts serve three main functions:
- Development environment setup and installation
- Application launching across platforms
- Windows build and packaging configuration

## Key Scripts

### Environment and Installation

- `setup_env.py` - Sets up development environment with dependencies

### Application Launchers

- `run_route_planner.sh` - Unix/Linux/macOS launcher script
- `run_route_planner.bat` - Windows batch launcher script

### Windows Build Configuration

- `windows_build.spec` - PyInstaller spec file for Windows builds
- `runtime_hook_vcruntime.py` - Runtime hook for Visual C++ compatibility
- `installer.nsi` - NSIS installer script for Windows installer creation

## Usage Examples

## Usage Examples

### ðŸš€ Running the Application (Choose Your Method)

**Method 1: Pre-built Executables & Packages (Easiest)**
- Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yammanhammad/Route_Planner/releases/latest)
- **Windows**: Run `RoutePlanner.exe` 
- **Linux/macOS**: Install the latest `.whl` package with pip and run `route-planner`
- *No technical setup required!*

**Method 2: Python Package**
```bash
pip install route-planner
route-planner
```

**Method 3: Using Launcher Scripts**
```bash
# On Unix/Linux/macOS
./scripts/run_route_planner.sh

# On Windows
scripts\run_route_planner.bat
```

**Method 4: Direct Execution (Developers)**
```bash
python main.py
```

*Note: All executables and packages are automatically built by GitHub Actions CI/CD.*

## Windows Build Process

Windows executables are automatically built by the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. The workflow:

1. Uses `windows_build.spec` as the PyInstaller configuration
2. Applies `runtime_hook_vcruntime.py` for VC++ compatibility
3. Builds standalone executable and installer using `installer.nsi`
4. Uploads assets to GitHub Releases

For detailed information on the Windows build process, see [../DEVELOPMENT.md](../DEVELOPMENT.md#building-and-packaging).

## Notes for Contributors

When modifying scripts:
- Maintain cross-platform compatibility
- Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux when possible
- Follow the project's code style guidelines
- Update documentation comments
- Add appropriate error handling

For comprehensive development information, see [../DEVELOPMENT.md](../DEVELOPMENT.md).
